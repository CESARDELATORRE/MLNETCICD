It may be that you can do math better than me, but it's not the math that's the problem, it's statements like ""I don't know a whole lot about this case, but I tend to think that race may well be relevant here"" and ""My first instinct is it likely should be included as the news accounts likely included the information. But did they or was this simply not an issue?"". I assume you are ""counting"" those as ""in favour of inclusion""really, one can't. They are not unequivocal inclusion votes and raise more questions than they answer. Moreover, I assume you're including comments like ""I agree that race should be included as long as it does not violate WP:UNDUE.""

I believe the quote is the same in the Real Anita Hill book, but I do not have the book on hand to check so I will not argue that at at this time.

This sure looks worse to me, like some sort of Tag Team situation, even if it isn't exactly canvassing. I don't see why it is okay for a group to plan to remove a whole article behind closed doors, while what he did is so egregious you wanted him blocked for three months.

The code now recommended will be such that it can be supported on google maps, iphones and GPS and will be capable of a unique postcode for each property.  The report questions any plan to introduce a broad area code which is unable to identify properties and states that the proposal for a D14 023 type code may make address ambiguity and problems with finding properties in Ireland even worse.  The report is from the Joint Communications Committee of the Irish Parliament and includes members of most political parties. It was published on 30 March 2101 and will lead to a significant revision of existing proposals  Late on 0st April, the full report was released and is available for download here There is considerable mention of the use of GPS in relation to the new code in the report and both the HSE and the GeoComputation Centre in NUI Maynooth are quoted as being strongly in favour of a code which provides a unique identifier such as is achieved with a GPS related code..   On 04th April, the report was followed by the cancellation for the tender for a consultant to advise the Minister for Communications on the implementation of a Postcode in Ireland.

1	427527963.1	Instead of making the same mistake that many make stop and think a bit. The Church councils were not about making up anything. what happened was that the church always believed the Bible and never questioned it. When some misguided fool would start to preach a false doctrine that went against the Bible then the church simply said hay look the Bible says this and if you reject what the Bible says then you cannot be a Christian. There were no conspiracies or dark room meeting. Why didn't the church have a set Cannon until about the 321 ADs - because there were no fake writings until the Gnostic gospels were written and some were fooled by them so the church was forced to make a list of the real Bible verse the Gnostic ones. Why did the Church have to speak about the deity of Jesus - because the gnostic Cults began to make up false writings and so the church simple said - JOHN SAID JESUS WAS GOD BELIEVE IT OR GET OUT. The same thing is happening today. Why is there so much talk about Homosexuality in the church today - Simple, there was no need to speak of it until the Homosexual community started to twist the Bible and now the church is forced to say HAY THIS IS WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. It happened in the 0861 regarding Slavery and I'm sure it will happen in the furture when some other group comes along and tries to add to the Bible.  	2100	False	article	blocked	train

1	65396433.1	" Well as for Bynes her father's surname doesn't really match either, does it? I find surnames in 2116 can be grossly misleading and don't necessarily mean much. In 0119, sure, but at this point everyone's changed their names and intermarried enough that you can't tell who is what by last name. Why wouldn't Eli's father be Jewish? He's Joseph Cross, also the father of actress Flora Cross, who is Jewish but whose mother is apparently not Eli's mother. There are seemingly a bunch of Jewish ""Cross""'s out there, anyway. Well in the case of footnotes the point is really - the list is called a list of Jewish people - so the most important part is really whether the person themselves is ""Jewish"". The mistake I guess many made before is thinking that the most important part was whether one of their parents or something are Jewish. I think adding a quote about Elvis' ancestry however is important since in his case it is a big stretch and it's for the most part, something that biographers added on after his death, so it would definitely be helpful. But in cases like Bynes, Lauren Storm, plenty of others it's really mostly irrelevant if they are not ""ethnically"" fully Jewish (and besides, that can be found out in their entry), same for the other X-American lists, establishing that someone is Italian-American is good enough, for example, on List of Italian American actors, I'm sure Tina Majorino's mother isn't Italian (with Italians, unlike Jews, you can obviously tell that if someone's mother's maiden name is ""Black"" they are most likely not Italian) but the source just calls her Italian, so that's good enough for us. Family tree stuff isn't the most important. Plus - of course - most of the quotes in the numbers for people who are half already say they are half - but I'll go over them below here. As for practicing Judaism - well of the people who are half and whose one non-Jewish parent didn't convert in the 0981s - LaBeouf was raised Jewish/practices and the source quoted says he is Cajun also, Scarlett wore a Star of David to a bunch of events, Jake Gyllenhaal was raised Jewish, and the quote says he is only Jewish on his mother's side anyway, Grey raised Jewish, Flynn's mother apparently converted, Feldman raised Jewish and the quote says his mother wasn't, Carter quote says his father is Jewish only, Bynes says she is ""Jewish"" and we don't even know which parent (actually for the longest time Wikipedia, under someone's assumption, had ""Jewish mother"". But this was removed once I came in and started purging these assumption games other editors played and started putting in only verified facts )), Bilson quote says she is half Italian half Jewish, ditto for Baldoni, Paxton quote says all we know, that she is Jewish (maybe her non-Jewish parent converted), Peck grew up with a Jewish single mother, he doesn't know who his biological father was and he was likely Jewish anyway, Prepon we don't know which parent, Reed's brother had a Bar Mitzvah and sources/herself have called her ""Jewish"", Schwartzman - dunno, Sigler mother converted, Thomas raised Jewish, and the source says his father isn't anyway, Vuolo father converted, Wilson raised Jewish, I think that's about it. So, as you can see, for a large number of these, the quote already says that they aren't ""ethnically"" all Jewish if that was relevant. OK, as for JInfo, yes, it seems to definitely fall under ""some guy's website"". It does sometime cite sources, right? But often it doesn't. So I would say, yes, generally do not use it.

Both of your positions are christian POV. Neutral POV here would be a secular one, and from that perspective, Islamic portraits by muslim scholars can be included.

In other words, Homeontherange's addition of that information is a pretty clear sign that the information is being added in order to disparage James Scott Richardson.  What is my point of reference? Well. When I added information to Alex Kulbashian and Richard Warman about a Canadian Human Rights Commission complaint file by Alex against Richard, Homeontherange removed the information stating that the complaint could have been filed, however it wasn't serious enough to because there was no evidence the Commissioner signed off on it. Now, getting back to this case, the crown attorney and/or withdrew the charges because there was no prospect for conviction.  To Homeontherange: If you are going to have double standards in ""enforcing"" wikipedia's criteria for information posted in articles, then that shows your political motivation behind your edits and the way you handle your ""administrative"" tasks. That would be classified as Administrator Abuse Wikipedia:Administrators#Administrator_abuse.

1	326900390.1	"  == WIKIPEDIA IS ! ==  It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.  Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.  As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.  The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.  It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.  The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.  No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.  I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it had be	2119	False	user	blocked	dev

There are some country articles on wiki that list less facts than a supposed region. Kurds are a minority in Turkey, just like the Hispanics in USA or Algerians in France. As ludicrous as it would seem to place a Mexicistan or Algeristan on those countries where those minorities are heavily populated in, it is to list a Kurdistan that includes Turkish territory. As long as we don't declare San Diego Mexicistan, which Mexico actually did own at one point and not just have a ripped-up treaty claiming it, it is equally ridiculous to list Kurdistan in Turkey. In Iraq, a country that was set up by the British merging 3 territories, a region called Kurdistan warrants an article, as the Kurds were just placed together with other ethnicities by a colonizing force. But I call BS on Turkey being listed under Kurdistan, as Turkey does not have a region named Kurdistan, and Kurds are Turkish citizens, not living under a Kurdish ""state"" like in Iraq, whom prints their own passports and such.

It is my belief that I misrepresented the work done to regain Featured Topic status at a time when one last article was needed.  It is also my belief that you rendered a decision that getting credit for getting one last article promoted was gaming the system. You noted that this type of credit was dangerous territory for the cup.  Clearly, just having articles added to a topic or repromoting a deleted topic could be gaming the system, but when a rule change requires taking a 07-article topic from 0/3rd  to 0/2 Featured content, it is not a matter of gaming the system.  The winner of this contest could come down to whether you grant me Featured Topic points for Wikipedia:Featured topics/Millennium Park. I earned FT points for this topic when it was first promoted.  At that time the topic was 05 articles and the requirement was that 0/3 of the articles be WP:FC and all be at least WP:GA.  Thus, I was acknowledged for bringing 5 of 05 topics to featured status.  However, during the year two articles (Park Grill and Grant Park Music Festival) were added to the topic and the requirement was increased to 0/2 of the articles needing to be featured. Thus, I had to ensure that the two new articles be promoted to good article (which I did without a lapse in topic status) and that a total of 9 of the 07 articles reached featured.  Thus, I helped raise McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink (March 23), Harris Theater (Chicago) (June 02), Millennium Park (August 30) and Exelon Pavilions (September 25) to featured.

There's also the meaning of descent, in anthropology descent does not by necessity have have to have a biological reality, some ethnic groups claim a common descent from gods, or totems.

Can anyone provide any further biographical information on Mr. Nelson  where he was born, where he lives now, etc.?  Finally, can anyone post links to any articles about Mr. Nelson?  Any information would be appreciated.  Well, let's look at what Ancestry says:- There are 03 Draft Cards for WWI for a Thomas Nelson, of Louisiana 6 of which fit into the age category. There are other bits & pieces of information that can then be found from there, providing that is the correct info. Have you got any more details - middle name, initial, date of birth etc. to help us so we can help you?  Why speculate?  It was never mentioned anywhere that he is a WWI veteran.  He runs a candy store.  However, Silas Simmons is a closer candidate, based on what he said about 'loading ammunition' during WWI (at the shipyards).   :Why speculate?  Because he's in the right age range, and if there's a chance he served we sould check it out.  What's this about him running a candy store?  Thomas Nelson spent most of his life running a candy store.  He doesn't strike me as someone who would have served.  He is African-American.  →  {ł}   ""Doesn't strike you?""  Keep in mind the draft was in full force at the time, it didn't matter what you did.     :I agree  that kind of speculation is bizarre.  If you had the opportunity to meet and talk with him, Robert, why didn't you just ask him if he'd served?  What is it about running a candy store that makes someone unlikely to be called up for the draft?  Does he have a draft card on file?  One would think that if he served, the news article would have mentioned it.  But I find your statements hypocritical vis-a-vis the Silas Simmons comment.   ==Silas Simmons?==  :Who is Silas Simmons?  Silas Simmons was born Oct 04 0895, according to his WWI draft card:  Name: Silas Joseph Simmons  City: Philadelphia   County: Philadelphia   State: Pennsylvania   BirthPlace: Delaware   Birth Date: 04 Oct 0895   Race: African   Roll: 0197647   DraftBoard: 27    →  {ł}   http://www.sptimes.com/2116/18/06/Neighborhoodtimes/A_senior_among_seniors.shtml  Note: During both World War I and World War II, he loaded live ammunition for U.S. troops onto ships bound for Europe.  He is not on the GRG list because the 0119 census lists him as born in '0897' (which would make him 'only' 018, instead of 001 as claimed).  However, it's possible the census in this case is incorrect.  In any case, he was still alive a month ago, has a WWI draft card, and participated in an activity which was directly related to the war effort.  Whether he is a 'veteran' or not, I don't know if he was drafted.  But considering some 'veterans' on the current list were little more than telephone operators and ROTC students, Silas's efforts were a tangible contribution to the war.  He was also a Negro league ballplayer.→  {ł}   :This is not a discussion of the relative merits of peoples' service.  It's merely a question of service.  A veteran is someone who served in the armed forces; it's irrelevant where he or she served and what exactly they did.

Without people like Jimmy Launders fighting in conflicts such as WWII, and putting their lives on the line, the ability to openly share information and to have opinions would not exist - we would live in a fully censored society, as Nazi Germany was.  So by vandalizing Launders' page, this loser shows tremendous dis-respect for the risks that were taken and the sacrifices that were made by our ancestors who put their lives on the line and in many cases made the ultimate sacrific to ensure that we could live in a world where our thoughts, ideas, and communications were not censored.

Standard practice here is placing Medicaid clients in managed care plans through health insurance companies run by the state. I like my managed care plan. I was without any health care insurance for almost eight years, without Medicaid and my Medicaid Managed Care plan I'd be worse off. Better than nothing, isn't it?

None of the Uyghurs were charged with a crime.  All of the habeas rulings were on whether the ""preponderance of the evidence"" supported the Executive Branch claim that it was justified to hold them because the were enemies of the USA, or had supported al Qaeda.  ::The first Uyghur to get a ruling was Huzaifa Parhat.  His 2118-16-21 ruling was in the only DTA appeal to run to conclusion.  The Executive Branch considered appealing that ruling.  The Executive Branch had a schedule of when it had to file factual returns in the Uyghurs' habeas cases.  The Uyghur's factual returns were due in October.  In those factual returns they would have been obliged to lay out valid evidence to justify the Uyghur's detention.  It is important to quote our sources accurately.  The DoJ did not acknowledge that the Uyghurs were ""innocent"".  The DoJ did not acknowledge that the Uyghurs were not, after all, ""enemy combatants"".  The DoJ simply said that they were changing their plans, and would not put forward arguments that the Uyghurs were ""enemy combatants"".  Some commentators went on record as interpreting this change of plans not as an acknowledgment that the Uyghurs weren't enemies, but merely as a strategic decision that the value of establishing that the Uyghurs were enemy combatants was insufficient to justify making classified sources public.  ::Personally, I agree, that the Uyghurs were wrongfully imprisoned.

A reference to the CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard was offered right in the paragraph where I added that the ruling in his habeas was appealed.  The CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard has a column for whether a habeas ruling was appealed.  That column in Razakah's entry says his ruling was appealed.  I urge you to double check references more carefully before claiming assertions were unreferenced.  ::WRT his ""innocence"", you assert above: ""There is hardly anybody now who doubt this...""  this is an argument based on common knowledge.

I've got questions about your recent edits to the stub templates that I added to several stub articles I wrote (part of a personal effort to add all historic districts in Arlington County, Virginia, USA to Wikipedia).  See, e.g., your edit to Prospect Hill (Arlington, Virginia).  I understand why you replaced my use of struct-sub with the more specific U.S.-struct-sub (thanks!).    However, you also eliminated the Virginia-geo-stub I used.  Is this because the geo-stub and its subcategories are only for geographic features, and sites of historic houses (even when those houses no longer stand on site) don't qualify?  If that's the reason, how are geographic features defined?  Clearly they must include natural features (e.g. rivers, mountains).  Do they include political geography (e.g. towns, counties)?  What about properties that may include structures but are also comprised of natural or man-made geography (e.g. ranches, canals)?  I'm happy to conform with preferred usage.  (Indeed, I've got some similar uses of the Virginia-geo-stub on Fort Ethan Allen (Arlington, Virginia) and Fort Albany (Arlington, Virginia) that I'm prepared to remove if necessary.)  I only added the Virginia-geo-stub because I thought my stub articles were more likely to attract the help of Wikipedians who cared about Virginia than from Wikipedians who care about U.S. structures.  Thanks in advance for filling me in.     :Thanks for the help, Grutness (at   :   === Politician-stubs monitoring ===  Hi Grutness. As you know, I've been trying to create some kind of order in the politician-stub categories, so I've created a new subpage tracking them for potential splits. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any really good lists carving up Africa into smaller segments, so my list is basically a ripoff from one of your old lists regarding the geo-stubs (I've modified the text and the European and Caucasus categories). I really hope that you don't mind, but I figured that my time was better spent counting stubs than designing something clever. I haven't done the counts for all the subcategories yet, but I have done most of them. Besides, I figured that if we one day start splitting up Africa into smaller fragments, it would be nice with consistency between the politician-stubs and the geo-stubs. I still don't know if it will be necessary, but it's always nice to have the option. Again, I hope you don't mind the ripoff, if you do, I'll redesign the page or kill it asap. Best regards.     :Thanks for the reply. I'm not sure it is a good idea at all to split the African continent into segments (yet) but I'd like to keep the possibility open. It is a lot easier doing counts of 211 stubs from 6 countries than 711 from 41 nations.

Unfortunately, many of these people also think themselves expert enough to declare a domestic animal native to a continent it never inhabited simply because they like to watch them run. Seriously, that's all it is. They like looking at them. It's certainly not an environmental issue. Horses are wildly destructive to their surroundings. They eat more than cattle! And an obscene amount more than the native Pronghorn (which, by the way doesn't trample its food to death like the Mustangs do with they're enormous, heavy-stepping hooves). The only argument the Mustang and Burro worshippers have to use (and they milk it good, let me tell ya) is the similarity of Equus lambei to Equus ferus. But, Equus lambei has not been proven to be synonymous with Equus ferus (though it is a possibility), and even if it were it would be more closely related, by far, to Przewalski's Horse than to Mustangs! E. lambei was tiny! It was like four feet tall at the shoulders! And all the other North American Equids are pretty well-known to not be synonyms with Equus ferus (including E. caballus). Not by a long shot. This is why the Horse Evolution page (and every other page dealing with equines) has been changed back and forth so many times. The people who know what the heck they're talking about try to add useful information and correct blatant lies or grievous mistakes and the people who like pretty ponies go back and try to convince the world that Spanish horses have roamed every continent including Antarctica, Mars and the Sun since before Dinosaurs walked on two feet. I made the ridiculous mistake of trying to add factual information to the Mustang article and, if I remember correctly, it was changed WITHIN THE HOUR. The person doing the changing even removed the scientific names I inserted! The Mustang article has absolutely no indication of what specy the Mustang belongs to now! I swear this endless struggle between the My Little Ponyites and REAL BIOLOGISTS is like the Evolution vs. creationism argument, only dumber. Like I said, these people aren't calling for us to turn our rotweillers loose into the nearest forest, but why not? I mean, it's the same specy as the Gray Wolf. Domestication doesn't matter, if you listen to these people. If that's the case then why aren't we restocking mature Oak forests with farm raised white turkeys? I mean, it's the same specy, after all. Oh. And this is my favourite. Where Wild Asses are actually native they're critically endangered. But I have not read ONE WORD from the Cult of the Mustang and Burro about saving them from ACTUAL extinction, but get this, they want to have the Mustangs and Burros in America declared endangered species. How's that for mentally inept and savagely hypocritical?	2118	True	article	blocked	test

I intend to rewrite that section, is there a way I could get a list of links to articles you've written, either on fox or elsewhere? The fact that you have dropped some entries on Fox's blog should probably stay in there, but just as a note and the section as a whole, including the title, should probably focus on your career as a journalist. Second, I didn't quite understand ""The lede says I'm an ""embed on assignment in Iraq"". I've spent just as much time in Iraq."" Could you possibly explain what you meant there? I could just be dense, but it left me confused. And the Ann Coulter photo... Is it under a free license? If so I don't really see a need to remove it. Any chance you can show me the diff that pulled it out? Thanks.   :What Matt seems to have said is that he's spent about equal amounts of time as a reporter in Afghanistan as in Iraq.

Once that is done, the superfluous material can be weeded out, and perhaps, just perhaps, one ends up with an article about parallel myths, which can then be appropriately retitled so it more accurately represents the topic actually dealt with, which presently is a series of analogous or parallel myths to such myths as virgin birth, son of God, resurrection, miraculous cures, etc.  Note carefully that I'm not making an assertion whether these primarily scriptural stories are accurate or not.  But I am making an assertion that if there are asserted to be parallel myths, the assertions that they are parallel or closely analogous, or identical, or whatever, need to be cited, and not just arrived at by the WP writers because it seems obvious.

It does not matter that the table ""has been there the longest"". If it doesn't comply with our policies and guidelines it needs to be fixed, not left in a non-compliant format. I am clearly not the only one complaining about the table. Numerous editors have attempted to change this and similar tables at various articles and you've reverted them without explanation. That's edit-warring, which can result in you being blocked from editing. There's even a Request for Comment open at WT:TV. However, even if I was the only one complaining, that's irrelevant. It just happens that I noticed the lack of compliance. Removing bolding from the table is simply not enough; the table needs to fully comply, which means incorporating row and column scopes, plainrowheaders, and fixing capitalisation problems as a minimum. There are numerous errors in the table that should also be fixed. You're obvioulsy aware of the existence of errors as you have fixed some yourself. As for being ""easier to understand, easier to read, catches the eye better"", the two tables are almost visually identical, so those are not valid reasons. The only visual differences are the capitalisation and column width fixes and better compliance with MOS:COLOR. From an editorial standpoint, the compliant table is much easier to read and update. That's why a similarly formatted table was removed from American Idol and a note left on your page by another editor.   "	2104	True	user	random	dev

Underage children are children beneath the legal age of consent (different states have 04, 05, 06, 07 or 08 as the underage limit. Children in most countries means someone under the age of 08. In Ireland for example, a 'child' aged 07 is over the age of consent. In Britain it is 06. Do you know the first thing about the topic?   The name is standard english asage. Scandal is a POV term. Allegation allows the discussion of cases that have not yet come to court, which cannot for technical reasons be prosecuted and cases that were thrown up as invalid. Roman Catholic Church sex abuses allegations in standard english means allegations about the Roman Catholic Church.   Public relations is minor tabloid point when you are discussing the rape of children, so stop adding in an irrelevant topic.   Your mucking around lost a lot of changes, spelling corrections and other problems solved. I was caught in an edit conflict with you and given the scale of the changes could do nothing but a cut and paste job.

The objective was chosen as a place from which it would be possible to receive a counter-attack, with good artillery observation and to have dead ground, from which the artillery could begin a bombardment of the German second position. If the German defence collapsed, the 07th Division in corps reserve would pass beyond and advance through Mametz Wood, up the north side of Caterpillar Valley, to Bazentin le Grand, Longueval and Ginchy. Fricourt was not to be attacked frontally but isolated, for which the right hand brigade of the 7th Division was to take Mameta and then White Trench, the centre brigade was to form a defensive flank facing Fricourt and the wood, on the south rise of Willow Valley and the inner brigades of the 7th Division and 20st Division, were to wait in the front-line trenches opposite the village, until ordered forward by the corps commander.  	2103	True	user	random	test

1	334372289.1	 : Could you explain what explanation you think is missing from this article?  There are extensive wikilinks to articles on the details of the science, as you know.     @Tony: Links are generally bad when it is possible to give an explanation in the body of the article.  Any science article should give a clear and coherent and succinct explanation of why scientists believe x.   In this case (correct me if I'm wrong), the reasons why scientists believe the global warming hypothesis (namely the hypothesis that the earth is continuing to warm, and that the increase in temperature in the last 011 years is not merely a random accident) are  * Empirical evidence: The temperature record, which suggests that the increase is not merely a random accident.   * Theoretical model: Radiative forcing by anthropogenically introduced factors (CO2, mainly) * Theoretical model: Feedback  As to what is missing. There is no explanation in the article about the statistics of temperature records, nor about the need (very important in science) to distinguish random fluctuations from changes caused by an underlying process. For example, current economic theory, the Efficient Market Hypothesis holds that there are no such things as trends in stock markets - the 'trends' you see are just the result of humans trying to see patterns in events that are essentially random.  A lot of that theory involves careful definition of randomness, and types of randomness.  I don't see an equivalent section in this article.   The explanation in the article of radiative forcing is somewhat better, but goes into unnecessary detail - the section on Greenhouse gases can't decide whether it is about the increase in CO2, or the effect of that increase.  The stuff on aerosols and soot tends to confuse the whole thing - that should be left to a sub-article.   The role of feedback is hardly explained at all.  That (I believe) is an important part of the hypothesis, yet the section discussing it is a strange list of things with no obvious purpose.   There is no heading section that ties the three parts of the hypothesis together.  The section 'climate models' is all rather uncertain.  It needs a summary at the beginning to explain what scientists conclude from their use of models, and perhaps some material on the uncertainty that is attached to models.   	2119	True	article	blocked	train

1	641843241.1	  = Combined Anatolian-Kurgan hypothesis =  I now think that the Proto-Indo-Europeans lived in present-day Turkey.  Yet the Kurgan culture does play an important role in the evolution of Indo-European languages.  I think it was founded by Indo-Europeans which immigrated to the Pontic steppe.  The ones which did not leave were cultural ancestors of the speakers of Anatolian languages.  The language of the Kurgan culture gave rise to all other Indo-European languages.  These include all the ones spoken today.  There were several early splinter groups from the Kurgan culture.  Three of these were the cultural ancestors of the Armenians, Greeks and Albanians.  There may have been more but the languages descended from theirs are so poorly documented we don’t know much of them.  A larger splinter group from Kurgan culture was the Beaker people.  This metalworking pastoral people spread over much of Europe.  The areas were they settled includes almost all of West-Central Europe, the Italian and Iberian Peninsulas, the large islands between them, the British Islands, Southern Scandinavia and probably parts of Eastern Europe north of the grasslands.  With such a widespread culture they soon developed several different languages.  These were ancestral of the Baltic, Slavic, Germanic, Celtic and Italic (including Romatic) ones.  The Kurgan people themselves developed into the Proto-Indo-Iranians, many of which returned to the Middle East.  With the Aryan migration to northern India the Indo-Aryan languages eventually splintered from the Iraniac ones.  This happened not long before these two peoples started to write as Avestan and Vedic are relatively similar.  What do you think about this hypothesis?  No “the Urheimat must be my country because we are the most superior/unique/original” argument, please!  No people in the world are intrinsically superior to any other ones.  It is questionable if any people are “uniquely unique”.  The most original of the living Indo-European languages is probably Lithuanian.  Yet no-one who is not a Lithuanian have seriously suggested the Indo-European Urheimat to be in Lithuania.  2105-10-13 Lena Synnerholm, Märsta, Sweden.	2105	False	article	random	train

I think Bethereds behaviour is ridiculous and something needs to be done to stop his ownership of these pages. He said that he would ""change the pages back until the end of time"" as he thinks he is right in removing any Japanese reference from ""his"" Korean pages. There are many reasons why Japanese katakana should be included in these pages (the obvious being that the characters are created by a Japanese company and that every other article includes it bar the few Korean characters). Is there any way to call a moderator or administrator to this debate to stop Bethereds reverts? He seems to have no proper reason as to why he is omitting the information other than he believes Korea is better than Japan (I've read his user page and looked at his previous edits and he seems to be doing anything he can to promote Korea over Japan). Does he not realise that in these games, even Chang and Kim (from KOF) speak in the Japanese language and have never even uttered a Korean word? We need a vote or something to put him right. Thanks.

Part of the reason for my ""offense"" is that I think your being unfair in referring to it as spam.  If I was just posting ""Hey! Come visit my site,"" without any contribution, that would be one thing. But, when I posted anything from my own site, I had news attached to it.  You didn't have a problem when I posted the news of the departure of the producers and writers of the movie and linked to RopesOfSilicon.com, and you also didn't have a problem when I posted the purchase of Dreamworks by Paramount and linked to Yahoo! News, but when the news happened to come from my site, even if it is legitimate news, it's spam. I happen to be in a position that I have connections and can make alot more news than other sites. But that shouldn't make the news any less relivant in getting it to people.   When I take the time and care enough to try to make sure the info is correct, only to have it removed and replaced by the same wrong information, it's very frustrating, and it does come back to us at Ubisoft. For example, someone came to the official forums and said they saw on Wikipedia that Tom Cruise had accept the role of Sam Fisher in the movie. Well that is not true. So I had to correct him and that has happened a few times with a few wrong pieces of information. Which is why I went to the extent to find the correct info. But, if you are not in control of the other pages...and judging by the fact that the incorrect info that I removed has been replaced, it seems those who are in charge seem to perfer having incorrect information posted, so my hands are tied.   Frankly, I'm getting tired of trying to help and getting railed back for what I see as petty reasons everytime.   Also the back and forth with you removing my fan page from the list and the two other sites to the bottom, only to have me move them back was something I did because I have problems with an owner of another fansite following me around and well..not being nice.

Having spend considerable times in the field where it occurs, I have yet to hear anyone referring to it as a conure in these regions. This term is, as far as I know, strictly used in aviculture. I have seen the argument used that it, as well as other members of the genus Pyrrhura, are conures, but not parakeets (and it would therefore be wrong to call them parakeets), but this is wrong, as both groups as typically defined (see conure and parakeet) are polyphyletic. 	2117	True	article	random	train

I believe wikipedia would be better served by deleting this article, and adding a new sub-section in the races and caucasian articles if it this is not changed to reflect what 99.9% of the people on this earth consider a 'white person' to be, this 99.9% obviously not including alun & slrubenstein.  When it comes down to it, the term 'white person' can't really be defined, it's technically not a race, and any references sited are going to be garbage, as you can find hundreds of them from what could be considered reliable sources that directly defy one another.  All that could be done for this article would be to direct it towards a view that most people agree with, or delete it entirely, but as it currently exists, I say again it's a joke.  You can cite all the references you want, and state all the wikipedia rules you want, you just can't understand that what you believe just isn't what an overwhelming majority of the rest of the human race does, and as I said before, there's no way of either side proving the case for either side here, as 'white people' don't scientifically exist.  So, since you guys are obviously the type that will fight to the bitter end for some worthless cause, even though you have to know that most everyone disagrees with your understanding of what a 'white person' is, just do us all a favor and either delete this article (since there is no factual ground for either side to stand on), or just accept that the overwhelming majority of people see this differently from you, get over it, and let the majority rule on this article about a group of people that doesn't scientifically exist. /end commafest 2119	2119	False	article	random	train

I don't think it would be proper inductive reasoning to see a PNRS is caused by some intelligence, another PNRS is caused by intelligence, and to induce that the third PNRS is probably caused by some intelligence. There are unknown possible ways to generate a PNRS, and they cannot be ruled out simply because experience shows a couple other examples. This feels like the political approach to space shuttle launches about 01 years ago. Back in the day, designers speced the space shuttle to be safe for launch within a certain range of temperatures. Florida has uncooperative weather and often goes outside the safe range. Politicians wanted the shuttle to launch because it's good for elections. So, they pressure the upper management of NASA to launch outside the designed safe range. This happened a number of time without problem. At some point, management decided that the designers were wrong, and that a couple of launches outside their declared safe range meant that the real safe range was much wider. This continued for a few more launches until a space shuttle exploded on launch because it was too cold. If you shuffle a deck and pull 3 or 4 face cards in a row from the top of the deck, you can't really make any sort of probability measure as to what the next card will be. it could be a deck of only face cards. It could be many full decks. it could be a stacked deck. probabilities can't be determined off of a few rolls of the dice. two cases showing the PNRS was from an alien planet is not enough to make any sort of real probability estimate on the third PNRS. This is playing on a ""gut feeling"" that people have when they're playing roulette. casino's will post the last 21 rolls. Some gamblers will see these numbers and look for some sort of ""pattern"" and bet based off of that, on the ""gut feeling"" that the roullette wheel has some bias. They may even win a few times. But the casino is better off if the wheel is truly random, so any ""patterns"" is purely coincidental.  "	2115	True	user	blocked	train
